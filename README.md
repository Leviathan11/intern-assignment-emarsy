Emarsys assignment - Levente Gubik

The tour_manager_1 is the Java application for the assignment:
  -It is more professional, thus requires more process for setup.
  -I used TDD technique (4 tests of the given examples, 1 for empty list, 1 for list doesn't contain one of the locations closerLocation).
  -In the main method of the Main class there is a "visualization" for given example4.
  
 The ruby_tour_manager is the Ruby application (Actually it's just a show off, i started learning Ruby 3 days ago.)
  -It is much more simple, but does what needs to be done.
  -The logic is kinda the same.
  -Example4 set up.
