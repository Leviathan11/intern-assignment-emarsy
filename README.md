Emarsys assignment - Levente Gubik

**The tour_manager_1 is the Java application for the assignment:**
- It is more professional, thus requires more process for setup.
- I used TDD technique (4 tests of the given examples, 1 for empty list, 1 for list doesn't contain one of the locations closerLocation).
- In the main method of the Main class there is a "visualization" for given example4.

**The ruby_tour_manager is the Ruby application** (Actually it's just a show off, i started learning Ruby 3 days ago.)
- It is much more simple, but does what needs to be done.
- The logic is kinda the same.
- Example4 set up.
